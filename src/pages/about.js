    <h3>Backstory</h3>

    <p>
      A little bit about me, I have been a VBA developer since 2007
      working for companies such as Barclays and Deloitte. For the
      past ~{(
        (new Date() - new Date('2016-11-01')) /
        1000 /
        60 /
        60 /
        24 /
        30
      ).toFixed(0)}{' '}
      months now I have been learning web development (JavaScript) and
      all the technologies and languages used therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m looking for a job, I&#39;m sure that learning in a
      commercial environment will accelerate my learning and knowledge
      as it did when I started out as a VBA developer. Ideally,
      I&#39;m looking for a role as a junior-mid full-stack developer,
      but I&#39;m equally open to front or back as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;m an analyst developer in the financial sector working in
      the City of London, I&#39;m married with a beautiful wife and
      daughter.
    </p>
    <h3>Coding history</h3>
    <p>
      I learned to code [VBA] whilst working my first &#39;proper&#39;
      job at Barclays Bank as an assistant to the finance manager of a
      business area, the scripting was to automate credit card
      reconciliation from SAP and for producing monthly reporting
      figures, I was lucky enough to have been spotted by one of the
      development managers on a different team and offered a job as an
      Analyst Developer back in 2007, for the past{' '}
      {new Date().getFullYear() - 2007} years I have mainly worked
      with VBA in Excel, Access, Word and in some cases PowerPoint!
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of solutions I made at Barclays were workflow
      tools, the tracking of a cheque or payment through a process,
      lots of greenfeild work with the focus on using the tools the
      business had to hand, so, no SQL servers, just the MS Office
      suite, &#34;user needs a database? Ok cool lets set up an MS
      Access db on a file server somewhere&#34; yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sectors I have worked in: Finance [Risk, Asset Management],
      Property, Oil &#38; Gas and currently in the Lloyd&#39;s
      insurance market.
    </p>
    <p>Tools of my trade: VBA, SQL some VB.NET and C#</p>
