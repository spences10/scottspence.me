This page details all the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I have recently changed to using Pop!\_OS [Linux] in place
of Windows. Windows is still a good platform for web development and
if you are a Windows user you can see how to use Windows Subsystem
Linux for web development in [this guide].

## Home

### Editor + Terminal

- My computer is an ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] 🦉 theme

- Terminal of choice now is [Tilix].

- [Dank Mono] font for both text editor and terminal.

- I have now replaced my [AUKEY 104 Key LED-Backlit Mechanical
  Keyboard] with another [HAVIT KB395L], such a sweet keyboard!!

- I run two HP EliteDisplay's E232 58,4 cm (23") Monitors through a
  Dell 452-BBOO USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station.

- Recently putchased a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser
  Microphone] which is surprisingly good quality for the price.

## Work

- My computer is an DELL XPS 15

- Keyboard, [HAVIT KB395L] (Kailh Low Profile Blue Switches)

## Desktop Apps

- For development I use Windows Subsystem Linux in conjunction with
  Hyper terminal. 👌 [See here to set up your own].

- For gif capture I use LICEcap.

- I have recently started using [Open Broadcaster Software](OBS) for
  recording some coding sessions.
