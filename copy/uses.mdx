This page details all the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I use Ubuntu 19.10 in place of Windows now. Windows is still
a good platform for web development and if you are a Windows user you
can see how to use Windows Subsystem Linux for web development in
[this guide], I also made a video for setting up [Ubuntu for web
development].

## At home: Desk

- My computer is an ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA

- Desk chair is a [HÅG Capisco Puls]

- I run two [HP EliteDisplay's E232 58,4 cm (23")] Monitors through a
  Dell 452-BBOO USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station.

- Keyboard is a [HAVIT KB395L], (Kailh Low Profile Blue Switches)
  really nice Kailh choc switches 👍

- Microphone, a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser Microphone]
  which is surprisingly good quality for the price.

## Editor + Terminal

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] 🦉 theme

- Terminal of choice is [Tilix].

- [Dank Mono] font for both text editor and terminal.

## Desktop Apps

- I use [Open Broadcaster Software](OBS) for recording some coding
  sessions.

- For light video editing I use [OpenShot Video Editor]

## At work: Desk

- My work computer is a i9 [MackBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)]

## Editor + Terminal

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] 🦉 theme

  Fish and Oh My Fish
