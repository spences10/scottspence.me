# For recruiters - FAQ

<!-- updated date: 2019-11-19 -->

Hello friend 👋, thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile, I
know I'm nothing more than a keyword match right now.

I really value my time, so I have gone to the effort of putting this
information here for you. I'm trying to save us both some time here.

Please 🙏, please, try to make it to the end. I know there's a fair
bit of info here and you have roles to fill.

## What's your current situation?

- Currently open to "opportunities".

## What's my ideal role?

- A good percentage of pair programming on the team.

- Working with React, Gatsby, Netlify and GitHub.

- Working in a team where there is an emphasis on technical
  development.

- **If you really want to grab my attention,** tell me how you
  collaborate, how you keep quality high, how you contribute back to
  the community, and how you help your team continue to learn and
  grow.

- Work life balance is a big deal for me, I really **do not** want to
  go over a 37.5 hour working week.

- Permanent, **not** open to contract roles.

- Working in an agile environment using best practices for
  development.

## What sort of company do you want to work with?

- I find increasingly annoying when the opening line for a company is
  peppered with buzzwords like AI, Fintech or when they're a award
  winning market leader I've never heard of (they're always market
  leaders).

- I have no issues with these sort of companies, just the marketing of
  them.

- Ethically I don't agree with Gambling.

## What's your preferred stack?

- I'm really enjoying using the [JAMstack] right now, with [Gatsby]
  (which uses **React** and **GraphQL**) being my framework of choice.

- For styling I have taken to using styled-components 💅, take a look
  at the used by section on their [site].

- For CMS' I'd like the opportunity to work with [GraphCMS] or
  [Contentful].

- For back-end I prefer node which is where the majority of my
  back-end experience is.

## How many years experience do you have?

- JavaScript 3 years

- React 2.5 years

- I started as a professional web developer in March 2018.

- I have 10+ years previous experience as a VBA developer for
  financial organisations.

- For more, check out my [about] page which details my experience and
  a bit about me.

## Salary?

- In my next role I'm looking for **£47,500**.

- I'm not giving a number for my _current_ salary because, among other
  things, it can be used to cap any offer made to me. In other words,
  my old salary becomes what's known in **behavioural economics** as
  an anchor.

- I know it's in your interest (being the recruiter) to get the best
  offer for me. I'll disclose my salary if:

  - (a) You agree not to disclose it to the employer without my
    express permission. No exceptions.

  - (b) You can explain how you're going to use the information for my
    benefit — needs to be a good reason.

## Benefits?

- I'm seeing an increasing amount of places offer "unlimited holiday".
  I'd rather know the minimum amount of holiday that _has_ to be
  taken. The reality is that it's not actually unlimited so please
  don't say that.

## Are you willing to relocate?

- nop!

- I'm happy in sunny Swanley

## Are you willing to work remotely?

- For my development over the next 12 months or so I will get the most
  out of being office based closer to more experienced colleagues.

- That being said I do know that [you can succeed as a junior
  developer in a fully remote role]

## What are your location preferences?

- I live a ~30 minute train ride from London Victoria/Blackfriars and
  prefer to avoid travelling by tube if possible.

- I'll consider roles three or four tube stops **max** from either
  London Victoria, Blackfriars or Elephant & Castle.

- Based in Swanley, Kent I'll consider places that are in Sevenoaks
  and Bromley, only those two places though. I'm not interested in
  roles in Ashford, Maidstone or anywhere else deemed 'in the same
  region'.

## Your skills look like a great match for this position we have. Can we have a quick five minute phone call to chat?

- Sure book in a [15 minute chat].

- **"But I have to talk to you today, my client's deadline is this
  afternoon"** I hear this almost daily, please book in a [15 minute
  chat].

- Please don't call without a previously agreed time slot, I prefer to
  avoid phone calls for these reasons:

- I'm on a [maker's schedule], which means interruptions are
  disruptive to my flow.

- I've already tried to answer the most basic questions on this page,
  and I've probably phrased them more clearly here than I will on the
  phone.

- This question gets asked frequently enough that my default answer
  has to be, if not **"no"**, at least **["read this first."]**

- **Contact me by email.** That's my preferred means of communication.
  If we are still interested after some fact checking I'd love to have
  a chat.

- Want me to know you have spent more than the three seconds nearly
  all recruiters spend on this page?

  - In your email mention "Quick Start Guides Rock!" and you will have
    my attention, gratitude and a guaranteed reply. 🙏

## Can I take a look at your CV?

- Sure, my CV is here: [cv.scottspence.me].

- The CV uses the [JSON Schema] standard, raw data [here].

## Do you have your CV in PDF/MS Word format?

- No.

- The link to my CV is my product and brand, as it was built and
  styled by me. I consider this a way to showcase my current skill
  level. If your client wants to see my CV give them the link.

- I understand that a lot of companies wil have ATS that you need to
  add a document to. I'll leave this part of _your job_ up to you.

## Notice period?

- Currently, ~~[two weeks]~~ two months.

## Interview availability?

- I can telephone interview with little notice.

- I can video call with prior arrangement.

- It will entirely depend on the location and duration for face to
  face interviews.

- Being the end of the year I have zero time available to take off of
  my current role for day long interview events.
