## Hi I'm Scott

<Small>
  Last updated: <DateUpdated date={`2020-04-16`} small={`true`} />
</Small>

I'm a web developer for Creative Products here at [Karmarama], based
in Farringdon, London UK.

I'm married to a beautiful wife and we have a beautiful daughter and
three cats!

### 👨‍👩‍👧 🐱 😸 😹

A little bit more about me, since 2007 I had been working as a VBA
developer for companies such as Barclays, Deloitte and Fidelity.

For the past, <DateDistance date={`2016-12-26`} /> now I have been
learning web development (JavaScript) and all related technologies.

### Coding history

**Back Then:** I learned to code [VBA] whilst working at Barclays Bank
as an assistant to a finance manager of a business area, the scripting
was to automate credit card reconciliation from SAP and generating
monthly reporting figures.

I was lucky enough to have been spotted by one of the development
managers on a different team and offered a job as an Analyst Developer
in 2007, for the following 11 years I mainly worked with VBA in Excel,
Access, Word and in some cases PowerPoint.

The majority of solutions I made were workflow tools, the tracking of
payments through a process, lots of greenfeild work with the focus on
using the tools the business had to hand, so, no SQL servers, just the
MS Office suite.

**And Now:** I have (as of <DateUpdated date={`2020-04-16`}/>) a 1,207
day GitHub streak, there are several OSS projects I like to contribute
to the majority of my commits are for my projects, feel free to take a
look 👀

I'm a massive fan of the [JAM Stack] and in particular the progressive
web app generator [Gatsby]. Right now I'm enjoying integrating that
with as many things as possible, here are some examples:

- [This site]

- [My blog]

- [My CV]

- [Cheat Sheets]

More details in the [portfolio section].

Using Gatsby with CSS Grid and styled-components 💅 is an absolute joy
💜

### Sectors I have worked in:

Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas, Lloyd's
insurance market, government digital transformation and now creative
digital.

Tools of my trade: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Preact,
Next.js, GraphQL, styled-components 💅 GraphCMS and Zeit's [now] and
[Netlify] for static site hosting.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

## My interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!

Before that I used to play tennis three times a week up to a county
standard, I'd love to have the time to play tennis again but between
all the above there's not much time left. 🙃
